  title: 'Contribute MDI',
  caption: 'When developing the site, I needed to make my icon. I did it in SVG format, but then I thought that I use MDI throughout the site and it would be more convenient to use a ready-made solution from this library. Then I sent in a request and put forward my proposal for the next release. This was posted in released 6.1.95.',
