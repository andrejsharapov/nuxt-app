    caption: Wines, cognacs and other spirits are so numerous on supermarket shelves that it is easy to blend in with the crowd. The design of bottles of any alcoholic drink pursues the main goal - to stand out. In turn, the color always carries a certain association with the public, so for the packaging of this wine, pleasant, soft shades were chosen, combined with smooth contours of the logo and modern illustrations. All these components evoke vivid emotions and make this bottle recognizable.
