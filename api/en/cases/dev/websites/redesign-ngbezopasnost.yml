  head: LLC "NefteGazBezopasnost"
  description: LLC "NefteGazBezopasnost" is currently one of the leading companies working in the field of industrial safety. For more than 20 years of successful work, the company has established itself as a reliable partner.
  issues: The old site on Joomla! did not look quite modern and ordinary enough. With a cumbersome control system, a lot of unnecessary functions, scripts, and other code, a relatively small amount of content was redundant. Lack of cross-browser compatibility and responsive layout. The main task is to make a modern official representation of the company on the Internet.
  task:
    - increased traffic to the resource, an increase in the number of online applications and requests from the site;
    - development of an adaptive design layout;
    - improvement of the interface and site design for all modern trends;
    - transfer of available information and development of original texts;
    - optimization of pages for mobile devices and modern browsers.

  message: We had a very good site, but it is outdated. Andrey made a beautiful redesign, leaving the site structure unchanged, but significantly decorating and modernizing it. I especially liked the fact that Andrey is attentive to the little things, working through each page separately.
