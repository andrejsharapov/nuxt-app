  message: We needed a beautiful site where customers could quickly familiarize themselves with our offer. In the laboratory, many types of measurements are carried out, and it is important for the client to immediately imagine how much a particular measurement costs. Andrey has developed an excellent design, user-friendly interface, and a special calculator (in principle, the whole site is a calculator), which allows you to quickly calculate the cost of all the services customers need.
