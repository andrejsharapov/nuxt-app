## Style Guide

You can use PostCSS, Stylus and Sassâ€™s SCSS syntax (view [WIKI][2]).

You need to use ESLint and stylelint to lint our JS, CSS, and Sass. Its configuration can be found in .`eslintrc.js` and `stylelint.config.js`. You can run stylelint from the command line via `yarn run lint:js && lint:style`, or integrate it with your text editor.

Thank you!
